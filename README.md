# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Machine Learning
## Analysis – The Data

This project will be analyzing credit card risk. It will employ multiple techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We will use libraries such as ‘imbalanced-learn’ and ‘scikit-learn’ to build and evaluate models using resampling. The algorithms that will be utilized include ‘RandomOverSampler’ and ‘Smote’ to oversample and the ‘ClusterCentroids’ algorithm to undersample. By combine undersampling and oversampling, we will use the ‘SMOTENN’ algorithm. Lastly, we will compare the two machine learning models that reduce bias to predict credit risk. Lastly, we will evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
